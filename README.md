# The Star Wars API tests

This is the result of a test task.

**List of tasks:**
1) create fixture which will return the array of all people
2) create test which checks length of array of all people with "count" field in response of simple get /people request
3) create test which checks that names of all people are unique
4) create a few tests for validation that search for people is case insensitive
5) create test which will validate that there is no page with number 0 for people request
6) create parametrized test which will check that there are 3 Skywalker's, 1 Vader, 2 Darth's (using ?search)
7) create fixture which will return schema of people object
8) create test which will validate that all people objects contain required schema fields
9) * create factory fixture which will return search people results
10) * create test which will check that search for any char in English alphabet or any number from 0 to 9 will return number of results >0 except cases of search by 6, 9 and 0. It is not allowed to use loops inside the test body.
11) * try to suggest and implement any other meaningful and suitable tests for "get /people" request
12) ** try to suggest (and implement if possible) any meaningful and suitable tests for "get /people" requests with parameter ?format=wookiee
13) ** There is some bug with implementation of Wookiee format. It would be great if you can find that and say a few words with your thoughts what is the root cause.

**List of libraries:**
1) pytest
2) json
3) requests 
4) jsonschema
5) dpath.util
6) string

*It is worth noting that something happened to the Star Wars API site (the certificate expired, in fact) and requests are not sent. But I think these are temporary difficulties.*
